                            Over-scheduling costs money. Under-scheduling loses business. C42 matches labor with when your business needs it. Optimize labor - your most expensive resource - with Staffjoy's sophisticated artificial intelligence.

                        <p>
                            Compliance is tough. You know the rules - 8 hours per day, 40 hours per week, 6 days in a row - but did you double check that math when you asked somebody to cover an extra shift? You could have just triggered overtime pay without even knowing it! C42 follows your rules to make business-critical decisions quickly.

                        <h2>Make Employees Happy</h2>
                        <p>
                            Don't put a morning person on the closing shift. Engage employees by having them pick the hours they prefer, easily request days off, and claim available shifts from their mobile device. C42 checks that they get enough rest in-between shifts, and it also tries to put people in the times they prefer.
